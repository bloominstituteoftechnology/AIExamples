    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

        //PROBLEM 1: Write an expression that you can log to the console 
        //that will concatenate these two strings: “What is the first part 
        //of a sentence” and “without the second part of a sentence?” and 
        //provide a space between them.

        
        //PROBLEM 2: Given an array of numbers, use the .forEach array 
        // method to find the sum of all the numbers in the array


        //PROBLEM 3: Log to the console a condition that uses both an AND 
        //operator and an OR operator that only has operands with falsy 
        //values, and prints the falsy value of the very first operand.
